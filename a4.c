Name: Mitchell Jones & Brandon Stolz        Class: CPS 360
Assignment: 4

Problem: Using the C Programming Language create a program that will simulate correctly the operations of
a half adder, a full adder, a ripple-carry adder, a look-ahead-carry adder, an even parity-bit generator, an 
odd parity-bit checker, a two by one multiplexer, and a four by one multiplexer. Do this using no arithmetic operators,
no control-flow constructs, and no atoi() functions. The purpose is to correctly use boolean logic circuits
in the realm of the C language. Using if statments (aside from checking the number of arguments being passed in for
standard error purposes) is not allowed, the goal is to use the boolean logic within our circuits to implement the 
desired logic.

Solution: Following the outline of the program, creating funtions within this program is not hard.
Simply convert the boolean logic of a circuit to direct variables in C. Using the bitwise operators of C
(&, |, Ìƒ, ^, >>, <<) we can iterate, combine, negate, add, and even compare through any number given using it's binary.
Every circuit in this program requires different logic, and in turn uses different bitwise operators. Specfic circuits
in this program use each other. The Ripple-Carry Adder for example takes the operation given in the fulladdr function and applies
it four different times, using a different value for the sum each time. That implementation is very similar to that in the real world.
When entering values, the program uses HEX values (making it easier to check whether an operation was run correctly).

Data-Structure Used: No Structs or User-Defined Types were used in this program (since there was no need being
that only boolean logic was being handled). Only low level and simple variables were used.

Errors-Handled: The standard error will read in whether the correct number of inputs has been used.

/*Problem: Display and run funtions based off of digital logic circuits. 

Solution: Creates three variables a, b, and c using the arguments given on the command line.
Create sum, out (result of bit), and outcary (result of bit add operation) as well as their respective pointer values. If
input has values that are below the requirement, display the standard error (usage).
Input variables into various funtions to obtain results, and display them.*/
